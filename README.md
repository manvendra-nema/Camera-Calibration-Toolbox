# üì∏ Camera Calibration Toolbox üõ†Ô∏è

Welcome to the Camera Calibration Toolbox! This repository provides a comprehensive solution for calibrating your camera using OpenCV.

## Features:
- **Easy Setup**: Follow tutorials linked in the documentation for a smooth calibration process.
- **Automatic Corner Detection**: Utilize OpenCV functions to accurately detect corners of the chessboard pattern.
- **Parameter Estimation**: Obtain intrinsic and extrinsic camera parameters along with error estimates.
- **Radial Distortion Handling**: Correct distortion using estimated coefficients and visualize changes.
- **Reprojection Analysis**: Compute and visualize reprojection errors for evaluation.
- **Corner Visualization**: Plot detected corners before and after reprojection for all images.
- **Checkerboard Plane Normals**: Calculate normals in the camera coordinate frame for advanced analysis.

## Usage:
1. Setup your camera on a stable surface.
2. Capture images of the chessboard pattern in various orientations.
3. Use provided functions to detect corners and estimate parameters.
4. Analyze distortion correction and reprojection errors.
5. Explore advanced features like corner visualization and plane normals computation.
